    <p>On the planet of Aldergate, the General Assembly embarked on a mission to end the rise of the WDIs. The terrible Darth May long ago decided that after many years of drought, there were WDIs that posed a threat as they had the potential to match his power.</p>

    <p>On the small planet of Saboeen a meeting took place between the WDIs as news of Darth Mayâ€™s plot reached them. WDIs from all over the galaxy joined to discuss what was to be done about this grave threat. It was agreed that despite their long struggle for peace, that they must fight once again to end the regime of the evil Assembly.</p>

    <p>The meeting was recorded on a simple droid R2DTurner but the droid, along with Ja Ja Stroud were captured during a surprise attack on a transport carrier. The message was decrypted enabling the Assembly to launch an attack before the WDIs could fully organise themselves....</p>
